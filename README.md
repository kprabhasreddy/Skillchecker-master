Skill verification is one of the issues that many recruiters, businesses, and even instructors confront when they need to choose a few out of many.
This is a blockchain-based system in which examiners may rely on a user's scores in a certain skill that you identify on the platform, i.e. SkillChecker. This approach also assesses and ranks the results without having to go through a significant amount of answerscript. 
This blockchain-based system authenticates abilities through examinations performed by numerous auditors without the need for manual verification of answerscripts.
